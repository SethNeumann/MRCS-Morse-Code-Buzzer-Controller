Morse Code Buzzer Controller 

Previous (pre-GitHub) versions, up to v4.0  of 20180302, as marked on the board
did not have an on board regulator and relied on the ProMini to regulate from a
12V wall wart of layout auxilliary bus.  Commodity ProMini's have weak regulators
which caused premature failures.  This version has a 7809 regulator to provide 9V 
for the ProMini which allows the MCBC to operate from any voltage from about 
10.55 to 24V (telephone supply).
